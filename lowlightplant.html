      <h5 class="h5-title">Lucky Bamboo (Dracaena sanderiana)</h5>
     <p class="content-dsc"> Grown in either water or soil, lucky bamboo plants can be found in many offices and homes. They often have sculptural or braided stalks dotted with little green leaves. An important element of feng shui practice, lucky bamboo plants are said to bring good luck and fortune, especially if the plants were received as gifts. It also helps that they have a well-earned reputation as being nearly indestructible. Lucky bamboo prefers some light but will gladly thrive in nearly full-shade locations. Just make sure they aren't located near drafty areas in your home. And keep them away from pets because they do have toxic properties. <br>

      <h5 class="h5-title">Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)</h5>
     <p class="content-dsc"> The spider plant is one of the most adaptable and easy-to-grow houseplants. It is so-named because the plant's star-shaped flowers evolve into spider-like green offshoots, or spiderettes, which dangle down from the parent plant's long, slender green leaves like spiders on a web. Spider plants can be grown as hanging or trailing plants in baskets or pots. They will survive for a long time in less-than-ideal light conditions, including artificial light. Make sure to water regularly to prevent the soil from drying out. <br>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h5 class="h5-title">Golden Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)</h5>
     <p class="content-dsc"> Golden pothos can thrive in conditions in which almost no other plants can grow, including very low light and a near-complete lack of water. It is one of the most popular houseplants, thanks to its attractive, durable, and easy-to-grow vines with smooth, leathery, heart-shaped leaves. Some varieties have leaves with distinctive marbling alternating along rope-like green stems. Be sure to loosen and dust the vines every so often to prevent them from becoming a tangled mess. Keep the plant away from pets because they are toxic.<br>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h5 class="h5-title">Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)</h5>
     <p class="content-dsc">The Sansevieria species are some of the best low-light indoor plants you can grow and they require very little maintenance. They are striking in appearance since they grow thick sword-like green leaves that can grow up to 8 feet tall. The snake plant, also called mother-in-law's tongue, is a very long-lived plant that can thrive for decades. It prefers to grow in partial shade but can tolerate quite shady conditions as well. And make sure not to overwater it, especially if it's not in direct sunlight that dries out the soil. Overwatering can cause root rot and kill the plant. Note that the snake plant is toxic to pets. <br>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h5 class="h5-title">Staghorn Fern (Platycerium bifurcatum)</h5>
     <p class="content-dsc"> Staghorn ferns are epiphytic, meaning they grow naturally on other plants instead of in soil. Their distinct green leaves can grow large and tend to look like deer antlers. As a houseplant, they can even grow mounted on wooden boards, making them beautiful natural art pieces. They prefer shady spots and can burn in direct sunlight. Be sure to allow them to dry out between waterings.  <br>

      <h5 class="h5-title">English Ivy (Hedera helix)</h5>
     <p class="content-dsc"> English ivy can spread as a ground cover outdoors, but as a low-light indoor plant, it simply offers a beautiful trailing effect of small and dainty green leaves when grown in hanging baskets. Indoors, place your English ivy in a location that receives indirect light. Be sure to mist the plant to maintain adequate humidity, and keep it in a cool room at night if possible (ideally around 60 degrees Fahrenheit). Be careful where you let English ivy grow, it's toxic to humans and pets.<br>

      <h5 class="h5-title">Cast Iron Plant (Aspidistra elatior)</h5>
     <p class="content-dsc"> Cast iron plants have a well-deserved reputation as being indestructible houseplants. They are handsome plants, though, with large and arching deep green glossy leaves. They can tolerate all kinds of neglect, including a lack of light and water. But ideally, you should water them when you can stick your finger in the soil and it feels dry. In terms of light, keep them away from direct sunlight, which can burn the leaves. A north-facing window is ideal. <br>

      <h5 class="h5-title">Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)</h5>
     <p class="content-dsc"> Peace lilies are popular low-light indoor plants that also can tolerate neglect. They produce large dark green leaves and bloom with a rare elegant white flower or two every so often. What they do need is ample water or else the foliage will wilt. However, watering will usually perk up wilted foliage. These shade-loving plants should be placed somewhere that receives indirect light. Keep the plant away from children and pets because they are toxic.<br>

     <p class="content-dsc"> The ZZ plant is a low-maintenance houseplant that can technically survive even without natural sunlight. Thus, you’ll find it in many windowless offices. You can't miss it thanks to the plant's shiny, wide, oval-shaped leaves that grow upward. However, the plant does best with bright, indirect light. These plants also can tolerate drought well and should be allowed to dry out between waterings. Keep them away from children and pets because the plants are toxic.<br>

     <p class="content-dsc"> Philodendrons are popular houseplants due to their ease of care and ability to add a jungle-like vibe to a space with their long green vines and heart-shaped leaves. Be sure to regularly dust the vines to keep them looking their best. In terms of light, a window that receives bright but indirect sunlight is ideal indoors. These plants can tolerate low-light settings but might experience leggy stem growth with sparse foliage. Keep philodendrons away from little children and pets because the plants are toxic.<br>

     <p class="content-dsc"> The Australian native Kimberly Queen Fern thrives in outdoor condiWax begonias are fun little plants with glossy bronze or maroon leaves and colorful blooms and they can be lovely low-maintenance additions to your houseplant collection. They appreciate some shade both indoors and outdoors because direct sunlight can stress them. A bright, indirect window is best for optimal flowering, but they also can survive in lower-light locations. They are toxic to pets, so keep them out of reach.<br>

     <p class="content-dsc">Polka dot plants are grown for their eye-catching foliage. They commonly feature leaves with a pink base color and green spots, though there are other color varieties as well. These plants prefer some shade both indoors and outdoors. Too much sun can fade the foliage colors. An east- or south-facing window is ideal indoors. <br>
